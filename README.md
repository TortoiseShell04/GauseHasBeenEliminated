# GauseHasBeenEliminated
A program to sort and solve linear algebra equations using Gause and Gause-Jordan Elimination 
# How to use?
Input the equations and the program will solve them for you.
# Can I input many variables?
No, for now you can only solve 3 equations with 3 variables. However, I am working on adding this feature soon.
# Shouldn't you solve this yourself for your exams?
This isn't made to solve your homework, this is made to solve linear equations easily without spending alot of time.
